              My name is Luke Pierce and I am born and raised in Lakewood, CO. I
              graduated from Colorado School of Mines with an Electrical
              Engineering degree at the top of my class. I decided after I
              completed my degree that I did not have a passion for Electrical
              Engineering even though I understood it very well. Web development
              is my passion, I taught myself HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby on
              Rails, React, NextJS, Python, NodeJS. My favorite language being
              NextJS which is one this portfolio is made from. I hope someday
              that I can live in a apartment/town home in downtown Denver, have
              amazing city views, and work for a small startup as a front-end
              web developer.

              Aside from programming, I am very passionate about fitness and
              adventuring outdoors. Everyday, I go to the gym and do strength
              training and cardio. I play sports leagues twice a week, such as,
              Spikeball, Volleyball, Basketball, Football, and Tennis. I love
              the mountains in Colorado, so I usually try to hike 1-2 times per
              week. Overall, I live a well balanced life as I am able to work a
              job that I am passionate about and am able to exercise and be
              outdoors all of the time.

              Someday, I would like to travel to at least 50 different
              countries, learn multiple languages, and visit every state in the
              United States. Below, are places that I have travelled to so far,
              but there will be many more to come.
